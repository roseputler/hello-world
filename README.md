# hello-world
Repository for Hello World GitHub Guide (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

While I'm new to GitHub, and am not totally sure how it will fit into my future work/life/work-life, I figure learning a little bit more about it would be a good idea! I'd lvoe to be able to show others (collaborators, future employers, etc.) code that I've worked on and am particularly proud of.
